# Training models on toy datasets

* This repository contains python scripts to train various models on toy datasets.
* This is part of my learning to understand the training process of different models and their performance on simple datasets.
* These scripts don't pretend to be the best way to train models, but they are a good starting point for understanding the training process.
* This repository is created as part of my learning process at [La Sabana University](https://www.unisabana.edu.co/).
